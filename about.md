Hi, I’m Emily.  
You probably already guessed my name.  
What you may not have guessed is that I love books.  
Oh, you figured that out too?  
I guess I’m pretty easy to read. (wink)

A former children's librarian, I love recommending books for readers of all ages. I read in a wide variety of genre, but nonfiction books are my jam. I live with my husband in the Texas Hill Country.
