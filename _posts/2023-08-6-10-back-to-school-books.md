Project Emily is back! After a long break from blogging due to the birth of my baby girl, I’m getting back into the swing of writing, starting with some of my favorite picture books about the first day of school. Books can be so helpful in preparing kids for the shift into a new season, especially if this is their first year in a classroom. While some of these books are specifically aimed at starting kindergarteners, many of them are appropriate for kids of all ages. Whether you have a nervous kindergartnener, a child who is worried about being different than their classmates, or one with fears of a brand new teacher, this book list is for you. Enjoy!

In this hilarious installment of the Pigeon series by brilliant author Mo Willems, Pigeon shares all of his many fears and questions about school. When will Pigeon eat lunch?

### [How to Get Your Teacher Ready by Jean Reagan](https://amzn.to/3KtnbzZ){:target="\_blank"}

In this adorable tale, the tables are turned: it isn’t the teacher who is getting the kids ready for school, but the kids who are getting their teacher ready! They show their teacher where the library is, how to make friends with the lunch lady, and how to stay clean during painting time. They don’t stop at the first day of school, either. The kids explain to their teacher how to celebrate 100 days of school, prepare for picture day, and even how to handle the hard days. This sweet story is fun and inviting— I adore the illustrations.

### [Amelia Bedelia’s First Day of School by Herman Parish](https://amzn.to/3OgpOpC){:target="\_blank"}

Our quirky, literal, often-confused friend is back, and this time she is on her way to school. Like always, Amelia Bedelia is enthusiastic about the new experience, maybe a little bit too much. Though her excitement can sometimes get away from her, Amelia Bedelia's positivity is infectious. Through many mishaps and misunderstandings, Amelia Bedelia learns how the classroom works and how to be the best student she can be.

### [A Letter From Your Teacher: On the First Day of School by Shannon Olsen](https://amzn.to/3DISrXJ){:target="\_blank"}

A former teacher, Shannon Olsen writes wonderful picture books about the classroom. In _A Letter From Your Teacher_, she writes from teacher to student about all of her hopes and desires for the school year and the relationship they will build together. The teacher writes about what they’ll learn, how they’ll grow, and who they’ll become over the next nine months. With a pleasant rhyme scheme and sweet illustrations, this book is a must-read before the first day of school.

### [Our Class is a Family by Shannon Olsen](https://amzn.to/3OLdVK4){:target="\_blank"}

Another from author Shannon Olsen, this picture book focuses more on student to student relationships, and how kids can expect to grow in their relationships with the other children in their class. In _Our Class is a Family_, children learn how to ask questions, make mistakes, and make friends. Children are encouraged to consider how special it is to learn together and be there for their classmates. This book is so sweet and thoughtful. You really can’t go wrong with any books by this author!

### [This Is a School by John Schu](https://amzn.to/3QoDCRR){:target="\_blank"}

In _This Is a School_ by John Schu, readers are encouraged to consider exactly what and who a school is for, as well as the many people it takes to make a school. Children get a glimpse at just how many dedicated adults it requires to create a learning environment. This book has an emphasis on the community aspect of schools, and the togetherness and belonging children can experience in a thriving school environment. I love the warm and inviting collage illustrations in this one.

### [A Tiger ­Tail: (Or What Hap­pened ­to Anya on Her ­First ­day of School) by Mike Boldt](https://amzn.to/3YqpPMk){:target="\_blank"}

In a sea of similar stories about the first day of school, this silly story stands out. One day, Anya inexplicably wakes up with a tiger tail! Anya wants to stay home where she can’t be seen, but since it’s the first day of school, she simply must go. Anya tries everything to get rid of her tail, with no luck. When Anya arrives at school, she discovers that many kids have traits they wish they could hide, and choosing to embrace their individuality is the best way to have a good first day.

### [The Night Before Kindergarten by Natasha Wing](https://amzn.to/3YpMtEO){:target="\_blank"}

In the same rhythmic flow as the classic Christmas poem, this picture book celebrates the preparation before the first day of kindergarten. Your kids will love seeing the very same activities they will do to prepare for the first day of school, such as filling backpacks with new school supplies, putting on their new school clothes, and taking a first-day-of-school photo. When the group of kindergartneners arrive at the school, their parents expect them to be emotional—but it ends up being the parents who are wiping away tears!
