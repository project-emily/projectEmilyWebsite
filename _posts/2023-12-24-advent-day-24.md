## Who makes you laugh more than anyone else?

<br>
<br>

Never was there<br>
Quite such a pair<br>
Of sisters just like them<br>
Three years older<br>
The younger, bolder<br>
The older quiet and keen<br>
On a book, on a story <br>
Nothing quite like the glory<br>
Of a laugh held tightly between <br>
Two sisters<br>
The older, smitten <br>
The younger held wit in<br>
The palm of her glowing hand<br>
The younger was wiser <br>
It didn’t surprise her<br>
It was her <br>
Until it was him<br>
Never was there<br>
Quite such a pair<br>
Of brothers just like them<br>
He fell in love with a girl<br>
Whose laugh shook the world<br>
Now it’s her <br>
And no longer him<br>
