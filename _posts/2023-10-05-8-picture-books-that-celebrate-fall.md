Summer time was large and bustling crowds, sweaty summer reading themed t-shirts, and piles of summer reading prizes. It was fun, to be sure— I truly loved the summer energy at the library. But just about the time when it became all too much, the older children would go back to school and I was left with my tiny preschoolers. The transition to fall meant smaller groups of kids, cozy sweaters, and all new seasonal material for story time."

I love the seasonal transition from summer to fall, and I especially loved it during my time as a children’s librarian. Summer time was large and bustling crowds, sweaty summer reading themed t-shirts, and piles of summer reading prizes. It was fun, to be sure— I truly loved the summer energy at the library. But just about the time when it became all too much, the older children would go back to school and I was left with my tiny preschoolers. The transition to fall meant smaller groups of kids, cozy sweaters, and all new seasonal material for story time. After a hot summer where locals all but completely rejected spending any time in the natural world, the arrival of autumn invites Texans to discover all of the shifts happening in world outside. I love fall books that emphasize the changes in the natural world, inviting children to observe and delight in what fall brings. Here are eight of my favorite story books about the fall season.

When the wind starts to blow the leaves off of the trees, Big Bear mistakenly believes that his sneezes are what is causing the leaves to fall. Despite the attempts from the wind to explain that she is responsible for the strong autumn breeze, Big Bear believes his sneezes are inspiring the falling apples and the flying geese. When Big Bear learns the truth, he knows that it’s time to head inside and get cozy.

### [Goodbye Summer, Hello Autumn by Kenaard Pak](https://amzn.to/3ZHI1Sk){:target="\_blank"}

In _Goodbye Summer, Hello Autumn_, a young girl observes the changing seasons through a conversation with nature as she walks through the woods. She notices the changes in the trees, the behavior of the bugs and animals, and the flowers that bloom in the late summer. The natural world speaks to her through its magical autumn shift, inviting her to hear the rumble of the thunder and feel the chill in the air. The girl says a ceremonious goodbye to the summer season and gives a warm greeting to autumn. I’m crazy about the watercolor illustrations in this one.

### [Summer Green to Autumn Gold by Mia Posada](https://amzn.to/3RL7w3i){:target="\_blank"}

Full of simple scientific facts about leaves and their changing colors, _Summer Green to Autumn Gold_ is a perfect primer for a aspiring young botanist. This book shows charts of common tree leaves so that young readers can identify their shapes with ease. The author notes the process by which the leaves change colors, explaining the green pigment of chlorophyll and the special job it has to make food for trees and other green plants. When the trees no longer need the chlorophyll in the cooler months, it disappears, leaving the leaves lovely shades of orange and yellow.
