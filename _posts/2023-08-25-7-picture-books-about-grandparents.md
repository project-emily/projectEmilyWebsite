One of the most exciting things about becoming a parent was watching my mom and dad become grandparents. After I announced my pregnancy, my parents thought and dreamed about their new roles and carefully mused over their grandparent names. It was so much fun to imagine this new season of their lives and wonder what their relationship with their granddaughter would be like. With Grandparents’ Day fast approaching, I gathered my 7 favorite picture books about grandparents and grandkids. Each of these books shows the important bond between grandparents and grandchildren and how much fun this relationship can be. Any of these books would make the perfect gift for a new grandparent, or you could even use one as a way of announcing a pregnancy to your baby’s grandparents!

### [A Grandma’s Magic by Charlotte Offsay](https://amzn.to/3EchO4k){:target="\_blank"}

A sweet, sing-song picture book about the unending magic of grandmas. Grandmas and their grandchildren are shown on lots of adventures, exploring and discovering beauty everywhere. Grandmas are celebrated for offering their time to their grandchildren and working together, whether baking, gardening, or sewing. A grandma’s magic is vital when things go wrong—nothing can turn a bad day around quite like a hug from a grandma. It’s sad when grandmas and their grandchildren have to say goodbye after a visit, but we can be sure that grandma always leaves a little bit of her magic behind. I adore the illustrations in this one.

### [Mariana and Her Familia by Monica Mancillas](https://amzn.to/3OTj29Y){:target="\_blank"}

It’s Mariana’s first time visiting Abuelita’s house since she was a little baby. The colors and sounds of Mexico are different and exciting, and Spanish words fill the air. Mariana feels nervous seeing Abuelita and the rest of her large, vibrant family. She doesn’t understand most of what they say and Mariana feels shy and embarrassed. Abuelita and Mariana share a storybook and a treat that bond the two, regardless of language differences, and Mariana discovers the rich history of the family from which she came. With a handful of Spanish sprinkled in, this beautiful book about the gathering of two cultures is warm and inviting, much like Abuelita’s home.

### [The Truth About Grandparents by Elina Ellis](https://amzn.to/3QPVxRz){:target="\_blank"}

This books challenges the many misconceptions children may have about grandparents, including that all grandparents are slow and not much fun. Some people say that grandparents don’t like to play, explore, or try new things. But the little boy in this story knows the truth—-that grandparents aren’t any of those things at all! This book shows grandparents going on adventures, staying active, and even showing affection to one another. Grandparents aren’t boring— they’re amazing!

### [I Love Saturdays y domingos by Alma Flor Ada](https://amzn.to/3QQTRHE){:target="\_blank"}

Every weekend, the girl in this story visits Grandma and Grandpa on Saturdays, and Abueliot y Abuelita on Sundays, or domingos. Cherishing her heritage of both European-American and Mexican-American descent, she celebrates both the similarities and the differences between sets of grandparents. From the circus to the pier, fun is had visiting both homes. With Spanish words sprinkled throughout, this story highlights the privilege of being apart of multiple cultures. Her grandparents share stories of their heritage and the little girl explores their unique pasts. This book will especially appeal to children with multi-cultural families.

### [How to Babysit a Grandma by Jean Reagan](https://amzn.to/45jZ8Mc){:target="\_blank"}

In _How to Babysit a Grandma_, readers see snapshots of a little girl going for a sleepover at her grandma’s house. She instructs exactly how to entertain a grandma, by going to the park, playing pretend, and making delicious snacks. The pair are seen looking at stars, reading stories, and making shadow puppets. She evens tells us what to do if your grandma is feeling sad and missing mom and dad. There’s nothing quite as fun as babysitting a grandma! Another book by Jean Reagan, _How to Get Your Teacher Ready_, appeared on my list of books about the [first day of school](/10-back-to-school-books/){:target="\_blank"}. This author is wonderful!
