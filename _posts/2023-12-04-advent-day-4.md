## Write a poem about how it feels to fall in love.

<br>
<br>

#### My Favorite Book

I want to climb inside your mind,<br>
Take all of your thoughts,<br>
And bind them into a book.<br>
Now glossy, soon worn.<br>

I would carry it with me, always.<br>
Always, I’d read. And read.<br>
On the beach, in the grocery store,<br>
Under my covers with a flashlight.<br>

I would mark my favorite pages,<br>
And underline phrases that struck me.<br>
Returning to my favorite passages,<br>
Again, again, again.<br>

I’d discover something new each time,<br>
Something I hadn’t thought of before.<br>
New pages arrive each day-<br>
I’ll never finish it.<br>

I don’t want to.<br>
I will never get tired of<br>
The marvel, the wonder<br>
At all of the things you have thought.<br>
