## What is an expectation that you could let go of?

How about 10?<br>

An expectation that I could let go of is that life is always going to be easy.<br>

An expectation that I could let go of is that the words and actions of others will always align.<br>

An expectation that I could let go of is that other people are always going to do the right thing.<br>

An expectation that I could let go of is that I am always going to do the right thing.<br>

An expectation that I could let go of is that there even is a right thing to do.<br>

An expectation that I could let go of is that life is going to be fair.<br>

An expectation that I could let go of is that I will always know exactly what to do.<br>

An expectation that I could let go of is that getting the thing that I want will feel like I imagined it would feel.<br>

An expectation that I could let go of is that the people who love me should always like me.<br>

An expectation that I could let go of is that I will always know what God is up to.<br>
