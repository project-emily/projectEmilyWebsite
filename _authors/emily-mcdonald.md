Hi, I’m Emily.  
You probably already guessed my name.  
What you may not have guessed is that I love books.  
Oh, you figured that out too?  
I guess I’m pretty easy to read. (wink)

I live with my best friend (who I happen to be married to) in the Texas hill country. A children’s librarian, I love reading and recommending books for readers of all ages. I also write marketing copy for book sellers so that they can bring attention to their books in the same way that I do in Project Emily.
